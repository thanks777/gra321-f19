            <h1>HOTBOX ROASTERS</h1>
            <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
            <p>Launched in 2015, Hotbox Roasters was brewed up by Oskar Blues Brewery’s founder and craft beer canning innovator Dale Katechis after he bought and learned how to roast on a small roaster as a hobby in the back of the Longmont, ColoRADo Oskar Blues’ Brewery.<br><br>
            Hotbox Roasters focuses on sourcing high-quality Arabica coffees from regions around the world. After sourcing, the beans are then carefully roasted by the Hotbox Roasters crew in Longmont to bring out the most unique and natural flavors. The whole bean coffee is then canned in infinitely recyclable Crowler® cans. The roasted beans are available nationwide in individual Crowler cans as well as a tiered subscription services. Whole bean coffee can also be purchased for food service in 5 lb. bulk bags. A year after launching, Hotbox Roasters jumped into the cold brew coffee game with their own Nitro Cold Brew, which is packaged in an infinitely recyclable 12 fl. oz. can.<br><br>
